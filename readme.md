# Lab Equipment - WIP

This site was created to highlight the equipment in a biophysics laboratory.  Product owner wanted to be able to showcase equipment available, equipment specifications, and other relevant information such as what type of experiments have been done with the equipment or what publications have occurred due to use of this equipment.

Initial plan is to set the images and text via hard-code.  Equipment does not change frequently so updating the site manually is not expected to occur often or incur significant labor.  Eventual plan will be to load all text and images from database to make the site most maintainable.

### Tech Used:
* HTML
* CSS
